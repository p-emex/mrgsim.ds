This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Package Does

**mrgsim.ds** is an Apache Arrow-backed simulation output package for mrgsolve. It stores simulation outputs as Parquet files on disk (in `tempdir()`) rather than in-memory data frames, dramatically reducing memory footprint for large pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulations while enabling high-performance summarization via dplyr verbs.

## Common Commands

All via `make` from the repo root:

```bash
make doc        # Regenerate roxygen documentation (run after editing @-tags)
make test       # Run testthat tests
make check      # R CMD check (skips vignettes)
make build      # Build package tarball
make install    # Install from tarball
make readme     # Render README.Rmd → README.md
```

Run a single test file from R:
```r
testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/test-own.R")
```

## Architecture

### Core Object: `mrgsimsds` (an R environment)

The central object is not a data frame — it's a lightweight environment with fields:
- `$ds` — Arrow Dataset (lazy pointer to parquet files on disk)
- `$files` — paths to parquet files
- `$hash` — xxh3_64 hashes of those files (used by the ownership system)
- `$pid` — process ID where the object was created
- `$gc` — whether files are auto-deleted on GC finalization

### Ownership System (`R/own.R`)

Two package-level hash environments (`hash2addr`, `hash2file`) map file hashes to object memory addresses. Only the "owner" of a file can move or delete it. Ownership transfers via `take_ownership()` / `disown()`. Files auto-delete on GC only if owned. This prevents accidental deletion when objects are copied or passed between contexts.

### Process Safety (`R/refresh.R`, `R/utils.R`)

Objects track `$pid` (creation process). Arrow Dataset pointers become invalid across forked processes. `refresh_ds()` rebuilds the pointer from the file paths. The GC finalizer only runs in the original process to avoid double-deletes during parallel simulations.

| `R/mrgsim-ds.R` | `mrgsim_ds()`, `as_mrgsim_ds()`, core S3 methods |
| `R/own.R` | Ownership system: claim, transfer, disown |
| `R/files.R` | `move_ds()`, `rename_ds()`, `write_ds()` |
| `R/wrapper.R` | `mread_ds()` and friends — mrgsolve model loading |
| `R/collect.R` | Coercion to tibble, Arrow table, DuckDB |
| `R/verbs.R` | dplyr S3 methods (filter, mutate, summarise, etc.) |
| `R/reduce.R` | `reduce_ds()` — combines a list of outputs |
| `R/refresh.R` | `refresh_ds()` — rebuild Arrow pointer post-fork |
| `R/temp.R` | `list_temp()`, `purge_except_temp()`, `purge_temp()` |
| `R/gc.R` | `gc_ds()` — toggle GC/auto-delete and notify flags |
| `R/prune.R` | `prune_ds()` — filter a list to only mrgsimsds objects |
| `R/simlist.R` | Internal helpers for working with lists of mrgsimsds objects |

### Package-level State (`R/AAA.R`)

A `.global` environment holds package-wide constants and state:
- `file.prefix` — `"mrgsims-ds-"` (prefix for all parquet files)
- `file.re` — regex to identify package-managed files
- `nullptr` — sentinel `externalptr` used to detect invalidated Arrow pointers
- `trashcan` — a subdirectory of `tempdir()` used as staging area before file deletion

Option `mrgsim.ds.show.gc` (set via `options()`) prints messages when GC removes files — useful for debugging ownership/cleanup issues.

### File Naming Convention

Parquet files are written to `tempdir()` with the pattern:
```
mrgsims-ds-{id}-{index}.parquet
```
e.g., `mrgsims-ds-out2-0001.parquet`
